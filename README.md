# hacker_rank

This repo is for storing practice HackerRank solutions in Python that I work on occasionally to stay sharp.

I started near the beginning to familiarize myself with the HR experience, attacking progressively harder problems as I go - these problem sets are not fully demonstrative of my full skillset.

Note that these programs are designed to fulfill the requirements of the assignments, and as such do not often have much error handling or logging - not for use in any kind of production environment!
